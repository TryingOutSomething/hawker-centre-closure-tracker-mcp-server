### 2. search_hawker_centres_by_address(address)
- **Purpose**: Search for hawker centres by exact address matching
- **Parameters**: `address` (string) - Full or partial address to search for

## Usage Guidelines for Claude

### Natural Language Processing
Claude can understand these types of queries:
- "Find hawker centres closed in Tampines"
- "Show me recent hawker centre closures"
- "Is [Hawker Centre Name] currently closed?"
- "What hawker centres are closing for renovation?"

### Response Formatting
The tools return formatted text with:
- üìç Location markers for hawker centre names
- üö´ Closure date indicators
- ‚úÖ Reopening date indicators
- üìã Reason descriptions
- üîç Search status messages
- ‚ùå Error indicators

### Error Handling
The tools handle various error scenarios:
- Empty search keywords
- API connectivity issues
- Invalid limit values
- Authentication problems
- Timeout errors

### Best Practices

1. **Keyword Selection**: Use location names, hawker centre names, or partial matches
2. **Limit Management**: Default to 50 records, adjust based on user needs
3. **Error Communication**: Relay error messages clearly to users
4. **Data Freshness**: Data comes directly from government sources

## Authentication

- **Optional**: API key can be provided via DATA_GOV_SG_API_KEY secret
- **Benefits**: Higher rate limits and more reliable access
- **Fallback**: Works without API key but may have limitations

## Integration Notes

- All responses are formatted for human readability
- Emojis provide visual context for different data types
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Logging is directed to stderr for debugging

## Development Considerations

- Server runs in Docker container for security
- Non-root user execution
- Environment variables for configuration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Timeout protection for API calls

This server enables Claude to provide accurate, real-time information about Singapore hawker centre closures, helping users plan visits and understand closure schedules.
